Argh! Officious legal bit!
==========================

	This version of the Story Store is freeware. It may be copied and distributed for any price to anybody whatsoever on the condition that it isn't altered or fiddled about with. Sysops can use the Story Store on their bulletin boards for as long as they want before deciding to register.

Registering
-----------

	To register your copy, send a cheque/PO for £3.50 (woo! not much, is it??) to :

		Quintin Parker
		6 Manor Court Road
		Hanwell
		London
		W7 3EL.

	Please mark your envelope `Story Store', so I know exactly why you're sending me money ;), make out any cheques to `Quintin Parker', and don't forget to include your name & e-mail address so I can send you free updates!

	The registered version differs from the unregistered version in that it is commercial software and therefore copyright. No copy may be given to anybody else, even if they're not going to use it on their BBS. It's pretty easy to tell if you've given your copy to somebody else, because that somebody will have the copy with your name on it. Personally, all I care about in writing this door is getting my money from people who use registered versions - there's no ars gratiata on my computer - and if you use a registered version without paying me, that amounts to theft, and I won't hesitate to take action. Watch it. No smiley, because I mean it.
	The benefits of registering are that you will receive free updates of the Story Store, and that I'll listen to you if you say there are any bugs in it. Things which I'm putting in the registered version include extra statistics, facilities to read the Story from a particular date or from where you last left off, a sysop-only maintenance menu, more features in the editor,the facility to download the story from the filebase, and the ability to have more than one user in the door at the same time. And anything else I can think of! <g>
	Now go and read how to use it. ;)
