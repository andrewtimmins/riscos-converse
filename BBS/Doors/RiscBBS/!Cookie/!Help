Technical details
-----------------

               DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND I HAVE ADDED COLOUR!

File 'CookieFile' in !Cookie directory contains the cookies for this door.

The cookies are separated by the preceding each cookie with the # character.
                                                        
To use this program in RiscBBS, simply place the following line in
'!RiscBBS.System.EventTexts.Logoff' or wherever you want:

{ runtask `<RiscBBS$Dir>.SubTasks.!Cookie -server HANDLE -door` wait }

This will run !Cookie in the Subtasks directory and display a random cookie.

If you want to add some more cookies, simply add them to the end of the file,
but don't forget about their # separator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command line options:

-door            (proves to !Cookie that it is being used as a door)
-server <handle> (gives !Cookie the handle of the RiscBBS server)
-trace           (not much use!)
-suppress        (makes !Cookie show just the cookie, nothing else)
-colour <fg>     (tells !Cookie to display the cookie in <fg> colour)
