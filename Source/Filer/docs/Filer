Converse Filer Technical Summary

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* SWI chunk base: 0x5AA40 (registered as ConverseFiler_). Current groups are
  Logging, Userbase, Messagebase, Filebase, and Statistics (reason codes for
  Statistics focus on call totals).
* Persistent data is stored beneath <Converse$Dir>, using USERDB/USERIDX for
  user records, FileDB/FileIDX/AreaDB/AreaIDX for filebases, and MsgDB/MsgIDX/
  AreaDB/AreaIDX for messagebases. Payloads live inside per-base directories.
* All SWIs operate on the Norcroft-compiled structs defined in h/structs. Callers
  should fully initialise those structs and allow the module to normalise strings
  and clamp numeric fields.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SWI USAGE GUIDELINES

* Every SWI validates its register block and returns 0 on success or -1 on error;
  the V flag is not used.
* R0 always carries the command enumerator for the selected SWI group. Remaining
  registers hold integer arguments or pointers as described per command.
* NULL pointers are legal; the module rejects the call and reports -1.
* Strings must be writable so the module can normalise and copy them into local
  buffers before writing to disc or logs.

0x5AA40 - ConverseFiler_Logging

On Entry:
            R0: Reason code (0-3).
            R1..R3: Dependent on reason code.

Reason codes:
            0 (System)
              R1: Pointer to C string to append to <Converse$Dir>.Logs.System.

            1 (Line)
              R1: Line number.
              R2: Pointer to C string to write to Line_<n> log.

            2 (Call)
              R1: Line ID.
              R2: User ID.
              R3: Status ID (0..3).
              (Stored in <Converse$Dir>.Logs.Calls CSV)

            3 (FTN)
              R1: Pointer to C string to append to <Converse$Dir>.Logs.FTN.

On Exit:
            R0: 0 on success, -1 if the parameters are invalid or a file write
                fails.

Notes:
            * Strings are truncated/padded to 255 bytes prior to writing.
            * The CALL log lazily creates its CSV file and emits the header row
              when it does not already exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x5AA41 - ConverseFiler_Userbase

On Entry:
            R0: Reason code (0-4).
            R1..R2: Dependent on reason code.

Reason codes:
            0 (Add)
              R1: Pointer to USER_RECORD to insert.
              Returns: New user ID in R0.

            1 (Update)
              R1: Existing user ID.
              R2: Pointer to USER_RECORD with updated data.
              Returns: 1 on success in R0.

            2 (Delete)
              R1: User ID to remove.
              Returns: 1 on success in R0.

            3 (Search)
              R1: User ID to locate.
              Returns: Pointer to module-owned USER_RECORD cache in R0 on success.

            4 (Authenticate)
              R1: Pointer to username (C string).
              R2: Pointer to password (C string).
              Returns: R0 = status code (0 success, 1 unknown user, 2 invalid
                       password, 3 locked). R1 = pointer to USER_RECORD cache
                       on success (NULL otherwise).

On Exit:
            R0: Command-specific result, -1 if validation fails. Search returns
                NULL when no record matches. Authenticate returns the status
                code described above.

Notes:
            * USERIDX is advanced automatically; callers never touch the index.
            * The returned USER_RECORD pointer is invalidated by the next SWI.
            * Text fields are normalised and encrypted internally; provide plain
              ASCII data in the struct.

0x5AA42 - ConverseFiler_Messagebase

On Entry:
            R0: Reason code (0-7).

              R1: Base ID.
              R2: Pointer to MESSAGEBASE_RECORD with updates.

            2 (Info)
              R1: Base ID.
              Returns: Pointer to internal cache in R0.

              R2: Message ID.
              R3: Pointer to buffer.
              R4: Offset.
              R5: Requested length.

            6 (StoreArea)

              Returns: Pointer to cached MESSAGEBASE_AREA in R0 on success.

On Exit:
            R0: Command-specific value (IDs, byte counts, or 0). -1 signals an
                argument/database error.

Notes:
            * BeginUpload/Create/StoreArea normalise strings and ignore caller-
              supplied IDs unless performing an update.
            * UploadBlock appends directly to disc and updates metadata after
              every successful write. DownloadBlock clamps negative offsets.
            * StoreArea ensures <base>.Messages.Annnn directories exist and keeps
              `.AreaDB/.AreaIDX` in sync with the module's allocator.

Notes:
            * Create/BeginUpload/StoreArea normalise strings, populate IDs, and
              ensure `<base>.Files`/`<base>.Files.Annnn` directories exist.

0x5AA44 - ConverseFiler_Statistics

On Entry:
            R0: Reason code (0-7).
            R1..R2: Dependent on reason code.

Reason codes:
            0 (ReadCallTotals)
              Returns: Current call total counter in R0.

            1 (WriteCallTotals)
              R1: New call total value.
              Returns: 0 in R0 on success when the value is persisted.

On Exit:
            R0: Command-specific result or -1 if the reason code is unsupported.

Notes:
            * Call totals are stored in <Converse$Dir>.Resources.CallCount. The
              module creates this file with "0" when it is missing at startup.
            * Call totals also increment automatically whenever the module logs
              a call via ConverseFiler_Logging reason code 2.
            * WriteCallTotals lets supervisory tools restore persisted totals
              after a reload or perform manual corrections.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLI COMMANDS

  *Filer_Status      : Lists the log and database files the module relies on,
                       showing existence and size for quick diagnostics.
  *Filer_Stats       : Prints aggregate stats (record counts, next IDs, payload
                       totals) for users, filebases, and messagebases.
  *Filer_FileBases   : Administrative helper for filebases (list/files/upload/
                       delete/edit) that wraps the Filebase SWIs.
  *Filer_MessageBases: Administrative helper for messagebases (list/messages/
                       import/delete) mirroring the Filebase CLI shape.
  *Filer_FileAreas   : Lists file areas for all or individual bases, including
                       the owning base name, access level, keys, and area name.
  *Filer_MessageAreas: Lists message areas grouped by base, reporting type,
                       retention days, AKA, tag, and area name alongside the
                       base name.
