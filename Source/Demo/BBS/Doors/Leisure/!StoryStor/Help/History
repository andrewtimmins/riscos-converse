v0.01ﬂ    First version.
          Oh good.

v0.02ﬂ    Bugs fixed : è The swear filter was being a bit temperamental,
                       throwing people off for saying totally innocent
                       things (hi Robert! ;)) Hopefully shouldn't
                       cause any problems now.
                       è Oops! Forgot to put the version number on the
                       title screen!
                       è Spaces between menu options and letters removed (Dane?)
                       è Accidentally left an icon selected in the template.. 
          Additions  : è Computer filter added.

v0.03ﬂ    Bugs fixed :

v0.14     Bugs fixed : è Oops! Now you CAN'T write over on the seventh line.
                       è Some icky things in the editor fixed too! (deleting
                         past the end of a line..) phew. What a boring bit
                         of code! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
          Additions  : è Rewrite of way the story is stored in memory -
                         now Wimpslot gets bigger as story grows, and
                         is read from memory using ARM code routines.
                         Thus fixing bug that David Hart, erm, found out :)
                       è Addition of statistics menu
                       è Will now only let one user in at a time. Putting
                         in multi-user capabilities a bit later! :)

v0.15     Bugs fixed : è AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGH! Dirty great bug
                         appears that only happens on other people's computers!
                         Released again the day afterwards.
