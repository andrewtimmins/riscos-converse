... V0.14 (15-Nov-1996)                                   : Unregistered
... By Quintin Parker of Gilbert the Hamster Software     : Freeware

Requirements
============

	1. An Acorn computer. :)
	2. At least 0.09Mb of memory.
	3. An ARCbbs compatible BBS server (ArmBBS, Newsflash, ARCbbs (naw))
to run it on. This means, if you've downloaded this and you don't run a bulletin board, then you're an immensely silly person. Stand in the corner.

What is it?
===========

	This door lets you have an ongoing novel on your bulletin board which all of the users contribute to. The sysop or somebody starts it off and more and more is added to it. Here's an example, from the story on Werewolf BBS:

skeletons, as he was making a B-movie horror film. It was all ready, the
cobwebs, the dust, the shadows, the creaky stairs, the little alcoves where
all sorts of horrible things could jump out and scare your trousers off. Tom
had even managed to persuade a few real live ghosts to come down from the
higher dimensions (actually, perhaps `live' is not the right word) although
there was now an argument about pay, because ghosts can't pick up paper money.

	...and so on. :) This really can work very well and it's become an extremely popular door on Werewolf. I have a hilarious 71K textfile that I can't release. (Because I say so.) But you can visit Werewolf and browse the whole story if you haven't already done so!
	It's thwogging brilliant!

How to install
==============

	I really haven't a clue. Sorry. I would find out for you, but seeing this is the second time I've had to write this section because StrongED stomped on the first one I'm not in a very good mood at the moment. It's an ARCbbs compatible door anyway. I think if you rip the code that you use to load Rick Murray's CastAVote door (I did too. Sorry Richard!), you'll be OK. The Configuration file contains the door number that you must fiddle about with, it defaults to 200, though you can change it should you so wish. Woo! And this neatly brings us on to...

 Configuring the Story Store
 ---------------------------

	The configuration file is located in !StoryStor.Data.Config, and has to be there, else the Story Store will get a bit upset. You don't have to put all of the lines in, because otherwise they'll default to erm, their defaults, but if the line `end' isn't there then everything gets confusing for it. The stuff you can change are the name of the BBS (to stick on things like `return to xxx BBS' or `this kind of language is not allowed on xxx BBS'), the maximum number of lines the BBS has (although I don't really think many Acorn BBSs have more than 32, nor ever will, at least not in my lifetime) and whether the swear filters and computer filters are on or off. I'll come to those a bit later.
	The five lines entitled `GoodBye#' are displayed once the door is left, except they're not, because they get replaced by a funky message telling you how to register. Sorry about that. But they're damn useless anyway.

 Error Log
 ---------

	The Story Store also keeps a log of all the things that have been going on in !StoryStor.Data.Log, because much as you'd like to, you can't sit watching people writing in it 24 hours a day. It contains circumstances of bugs and so on as well as errors that are your fault (it tells you), and it also shows when people get caught by the various filters or try to enter when they're banned.
	If the log gets deleted, then Story Store will happily create you a new one.

 The Story itself
 ----------------

	You can edit and amend what people say, and even delete whole sections, in a simple text editor. The format is continuous in one file, !StoryStor.Data.StorySoFar, and is in this orientation ..

 >username<
 >date<
 >line 1 of story<
 >line 2 of story<
 >line 3 of story<
  ...
 >line 7 of story<
 >username<
 >date<
 >line 1 of story<
  ...
 >line 7 of story<

	etc. The last entry in the story will always have ** THE END ** -PLUS- a return (&0a) char afterwards as the next username, followed by, well, nothing really. If the users do not fill their seven lines, then the remaining lines will be left blank with only a return char in them. Therefore, the total number of lines in this file must equal to (9 x entries)+1. If this is not true, then the Story Store gets a bit muddled. It won't do so on its own, but be careful when you edit it. You'll be told anyway if you've made a cock up.
	If this file goes missing, you're in trouble.

 Banned users
 ------------

	This is simply a list of usernames, terminated by ** THE END ** again, in the file !StoryStor.Data.Forbidden, which the program will not let into the Story until they are removed from the file by the sysop. This can stop problem users writing rubbish in the door, and can give the sysop more peace of mind.
	Users are immediately banned if they swear and the filter catches them. If the computer filter is on, then if the program decides that they're talking about computers at any great length, then it will roll a dice. There is a one in three chance that they may be banned, or otherwise they'll be kicked out but let off with a warning. You may think that a one in three chance is a bit arbitary. Life is arbitary. The winds of destiny and fate dispense justice seemingly randomly also, so why shouldn't this program harness these laws of the Universe and decide when a user should be rightly banned, I ask you?
	Of course, the other reason is that I may not have been bothered to write a decent AI routine. <g>

A word about the filters
========================

	There are two filters in the Story Store, a swear one and a computer one. The swear one I consider pretty much mandatory, in an environment where kids can easily be looking at the computer, and wherein there are many pillocks for whom swear words are the only things that are funny. The filter contains all the stronger words, and is sensible enough not to ban people should they decide they want to write about Scunthorpe. :) If you notice that someone's slipped through though, do tell me what word I've neglected to put in (don't worry, I'm pretty broad minded <g>), and don't forget that you can always censor the story and add the user to the Forbidden list yourself.
	The computer one is more controversial. When I added this in, people started to scream `freedom of speech' at me, which is all well and good, but doesn't account for the fact that computers are not actually very enthralling subjects for a novel, that many BBS users would be either unable or unwilling to continue a story that talked about the finer points of the Wimp Messaging protocol, and that the story would therefore begin to lose its popularity. It's up to you really, that's why I made it configurable. So there. :)

Usage of the door itself
========================

	This is pretty much self-explanatory really. If you do get stuck, then you can always read the online help within the door.

Right.. interesting bits. Hellos
================================

	I've been wanting to do this for a while now, so here goes...

 People I know called David v People I know called Robert

Well, I really can't be bothered to set it out neatly. I'm tired. Better get
this uploaded and get off to sleep!

Bye!
