Help for !WorldTime version 1.00
(c) Matthew Page 1996 
=================================

Whilst trying a number of PC BB's one weekend, I came across a door that
gave world times, in a style that you may find at an airport. 

I thaught that this would be a good door to port over to the Acorn system,
so here it is!

If you wanna give me some dosh, or you find any bugs in this door, please
get in touch.  

I can be contacted at:

mpage@mossoft.demon.co.uk
7:44/106.0 @ Riscnet
2:256/701.11 @ Fidonet
50:12/1.0 @ X-Net

online: ARM Pit BBS - number is published on all good Acorn BB's

==================================
Instalation
==================================

This door will work on any ArcBBS compatible server, just set your desired
door number in the `configure` file, within this directory, and call as you
would any other door.

eg.

ArmBBS:

 defitem W
 display `World Time`
 [
   doing `Seeing World Time`
   log `>World Time`
   door `1 33 <ArmBBS$Dir>.Doors.Utils.!WorldTime`
 ]
 enditem

ArcBBS:

OSCLI "WimpTask <ArcBBS$Dir>.Doors.!WorldTime"
DOOR 33

Any other server:

 erm...work it out yourself! ;-)

Andrew Lobel has also written a similar door to this, and no doubt he 
will probably make a fuss about this one. BUT....my version better than his
because:

 > Andrew Lobels' doesn't work out the times correctly
 > Andrew Lobels' has a crappy Intercomm BBS advert at the end
 > Andrew Lobels' is written by Andrew Lobel (i.e nobody wants to use his 
                                              version, coz no-one likes him)

I thaught I should get that off my chest ;-D
Ok, there is nothing more to say, apart from, have fun! and see ya round!
