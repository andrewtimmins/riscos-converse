          How to set the door up
          ======================

Firstly you will need to edit the config file
Set the doornumber you wish trivia to repond to.
Set whether or not you want users to be able to gamle their ratios.
Set the UpdownConf, OnlineConf and Confdivide to your wishes
Set the Quit delay.

Some example questions are already included with the door but so that
users don't know the answers you are advised to add your own questions
to the respective files to at least 30 questions per topic.

Next you need to write the Menu data files for ARCbbs an example is
given below. This Shows the user the instruction screen, then enters
the door, and after the game displays the high score:

|trivia game
DOING"Trivia game"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.TrivIns
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                                Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
OSCLI "WimpTask <ARCserver$Dir>.^!TrivDoor"
DOOR 6
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                                Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.TrivScr
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                                Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
GOTO game

Below is also a little file to display the high scores:

| Trivia Scores
DOING "Trivia Scores"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.TrivScr
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                             Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
GOTO game
|

An example Instruction page is also included within this application
called TrivIns
