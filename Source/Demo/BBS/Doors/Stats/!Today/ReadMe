What this application does, is create a file called
<ArmBBS$Dir>.BBS.Today, which gives some day
specific information.  Without using a door!

In order for this to be used, you need to add the
command 'type <ArmBBS$Dir>.BBS.Today' at the end of
your BBS.Login file.  This will display the info,
then ask for a key to be pressed.  The application
must be re-run every day to update the file.  This
is best be done using a repeating task alarm from
!Alarm (in my opinion).

Please tell me if you find any bugs. I don't think
it's perfect, but adding in a blank line at the end
of each file should fix a possible bug.  I only
wrote it today (7/8/94) in about an hour from when I
got the 'today' files, so it's bound to have at
least one flaw.

This program is totally uncopyrighted because it is
_so_ simple anyone could do it, and I'm just saving
them the trouble!  Feel free to adjust it to your
own personal needs, 'cos I don't care.  And if you
want to design a sprite, then do.  I can't draw to
save my life!

Oh yeah, the format of the cookie file is:
[0c] (ie ASCII 12)
<Text>
....
Simple, eh?  For the format of the today files,
read !Today.Today.Today_Doc
