Here it is! The *second* program from BUDGIESOFT.

!ReadTasks 2 is an ArcBBS door that will display all the active tasks
operating on the DeskTop to a user.

This is version 2 of the program. It'll automatically detect if the user
has an ANSI terminal, and if so it'll output in colour!

This may not be the easiest ArcBBS door to set up, but it is written in
BASIC and has been made easy to adjust. Don't like the colours used?
No problem!

So, if you are a SysOp... Stop wasting time reading this and press [Q].
