Introduction to Converse - the ultimate in 8-way communications!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Converse is an 8-way split screen chat door for Arc/ArmBBS. It should also work
with NewsFlash, which also provides (albeit limited) ArcBBS doors emulation.

Until recently, the excellent Virtual Cafe has stood practically unchallenged in
the field of split-screen chats. Unfortunately, VC only provides a 4-way chat.
Some BBSes have now got 4 or more lines, creating obvious problems as often
some users are left out of the conversation. To solve this problem I designed
and programmed Converse - the ultimate in 8-way communications!

Converse is written in 100% hand-crafted assembler for speed. This makes an
8-way chat feasible, because there is little processor time used. A by-product
of this is the fact that Converse takes up extremely small amounts of memory on
the server machine. In fact, Converse fits comfortably into 32k, so there are
no problems there.

Also - another first for Converse! The paging system used here is superior to
any other previous pagers - as it updates the list of users in realtime.
Therefore, you can sit in the paging screen quite happily and watch all the
users go about their business. This is pretty useful, as you can wait until a
user comes out of another door before attempting to page him.


How do I use Converse?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This archive will only really be of use to sysops of Arc/ArmBBS (or NewsFlash)
systems. However, as will be discussed below these sysops are more than welcome
to provide this documentation for their users' information. Therefore, here are
instructions on using Converse from a users' point of view!

After entering the door from the BBS, you are faced with the main chat screen.
From here, you can do several things, as listed below....

Ctrl+R  Redraw screen
Ctrl+L  Clear text window
Ctrl+C  Quit
Ctrl+Q  Quit
Ctrl+T  Show time remaining
Ctrl+P  Enter paging screen

These are all pretty straightforward...

On entering the paging screen, you are presented with a list of users. This
list is updated in realtime as mentioned earlier. After typing your desired
port number that user will be paged (in an extremely polite fashion). Should
there be any problems (like the user is in another door) then you will be
informed of this.


Using Converse with *your* BBS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are some skeletal instructions for setting Converse up for use with your
BBS. Obviously this will only make sense to sysops, and many sysops may wish to
alter these entry routines to make them more 'sophisticated'. However, this is
how you do it, basically...



ARCbbs Instructions:

OSCLI "WimpTask  <ArmBBS$Dir>.Doors.!Converse -door 69"
DOOR 69



ArmBBS Instructions:

  defitem H
  help `Converse`
  access
  [
    doing `Converse`
    door `1 69 <ArmBBS$Dir>.Doors.!Converse -door 69`
    anykey
  ]
  enditem



Newsflash Instructions:

if option="6" then
report "Converse 8 Way Chat"
print "Converse"
runtask "<NewsFlash$BBS>Chats.!Converse -door 69"
startarcbbsdoor 69
attr 7,0
anykey
endif


Any problems, get in touch.


Forseeable Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This door is now 'finished' - in that I won't probably be doing much more work
on it. Any suggestions will however be appriciated, but only if they are
attached to a ten pound note.... ;D


Credits
~~~~~~~
Thanks must go to...

* David Dade, John Stonier, Chris Jackson and Alex Howarth for testing Converse
on their BBSes - without their help Converse certainly wouldn't be where it is
today.

* Richard Sargeant for pointing out mistakes in my code and giving me ideas
about various things.

* Graham Cant for information about implementing chat programs. Virtual Cafe is
of course copyright © Graham Cant.

* Andy Jones for giving me some friendly competition, helping this door become
finished more quickly. Competition always helps a project along.

* James Larcombe for some graphics, design, documentation and suggestions.

* Quintin Parker and Owen Shave for early slagging offs, and suggestions for a
colour change.

* Various pieces of music including Highlights from Phantom of the Opera, Les
Miserables, Green Day and anything that was played on TFM 96.6FM radio
station. (Who use Acorns BTW).

                         ______________


Dedicated to Esther for defining the real meaning of  beautiful,
when I thought it was a Risc PC 700.

If they should send me some money (tenner?) then I would be more than happy to

to develop and test. Please reward this effort in some way, as even though we
are distributing this software for no cost it would be lovely for someone to
recognize the large amounts of hard work involved.
