I'm no longer asking for money, but if you ever feel the urge to dip into your
pocket and help out with the running costs of the {fg 3}biggest and best Acorn
based BBS in the middle of England{fg 7}, please read the file about donations in
the Areas Menu {fg 2}(A from main menu){fg 7}. 

{fg 6}You are currently an {fg 1}Unregistered{fg 6} user.

{fg 3}Registering with the BBS has many advantages:{fg 6}

{fg 2}a) It gives you longer online times and a 100:1 download:upload ratio
  instead of the normal 10:1.

{fg 3}b) A higher user-level also means more access to the system.

{fg 2}c) You get write access to the netmail and internet email message areas.

{fg 3}d) You get a Registered 'key' in your user record!

{fg 2}e) It's free - unlike some other BBS's

{fg 3}f) You get access to the special Registered users Area in Areas menu!

{fg 6}When you've been registered, you can {fg 3}download one hundred times{fg 6} the
amount you've {fg 1}uploaded,{fg 6} and get {fg 3}75{fg 6} minutes online time instead of {fg 1}30{fg 6}.
you also get a nice little green '{fg 2}[ Registered ]{fg 6}' in the menus instead of a
red '{fg 1}[Unregistered]{fg 6}', your user-level goes up to {fg 3}100{fg 6}, from {fg 1}25{fg 6},
and you get the '*' character in the userlists to signify your importance to
other users!

{fg 3}Enjoy the system and happy browsing.{fg 6}  

{fg 7}If you aren't a validated user, you may consider getting yourself validated by
