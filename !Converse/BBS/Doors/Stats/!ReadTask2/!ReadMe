!ReadTasks 2 by Richard Murray
============================

*** THIS IS A BUDGIESOFT PRODUCTION.***

This program is FREEWARE. (C) Richard Murray , June 1st 1994.




How to install:

1.  UnSpark the program to your DOORS directory.
2.  Load the !RunImage into !Edit.
3.  Thump F4 and type "DOORNUMBER" (without the quotes!) into the Find icon.
    Click on GO.
    You'll see a line that says:
     "*| **** CHANGE THE 21 IN THE LINE BELOW TO ALTER THE DOORNUMBER! ****"
4.  The line below will say:
     "IF s%=21 THEN"
    Simply change the 21 to whatever number you want the door to respond to.
5.  Save the !RunImage file.

* Note : A backup !RunImage called '!RI_Backup' is provided in case you make
         a mistake and the program refuses to run...

6.  Create a menu option for the door as per normal (consult your ArcBBS user
    guide for details on how to do this).

7.  A suggested menu file to run the program is given below:

      | Reading Task list
      DOING "Reading Tasklist"
      OSCLI "WimpTask scsi::BBS.$.Doors.!ReadTasks"
      
      ECHO "{std cls bold}Please wait - Attempting to connect...{|}"
      DOOR 21
      | ECHO "{_>0023 bfgbg wb}Press any key{eol std}"
      ANYKEY
      GOTO on-line

    You will need to change the OSCLI filename to point to your own file
    location. You can do this in !Edit (RiscOS3) by dragging the !ReadTasks
    application into !Edit whilst holding down SHIFT. The full filename will
    be inserted at the current caret position.

    You will also need to change the DOOR 21 line to what you decided to make
    the door earlier.




Extensions:

  è This program now supports colour. It'll automatically detect what type of
    terminal the user has selected, and add colours for ANSI. Dumb, VT52 and
    VT100 terminals will still be monochrome, although I might later use a
    combination of bold/normal at a basic level to 'emulate' the colours on
    VT100 :-).

  è It has been made *very* easy for you to change the colours used if you do
    not like the defaults.
    Again, load the program into !Edit. Search for 'PROCcolour'. You will see
    'PROCcolour(36,0)'.
    The first colour is the foreground colour, the second being the back-
    ground colour. You don't need to specify a background colour, but it must
    be 0 if it isn't a colour!
    The ANSI colours are:
      Black   - 30        These colours shown are the foreground
      Red     - 31        colours.
      Green   - 32
      Yellow  - 33        The background colours are 10 more, eg..
      Blue    - 34        from 40 to 47.
      Magenta - 35
      Cyan    - 36        These codes are the same as the
      White   - 37        ISO 6429 standard.
    Also...
      Bold on - 1         \_ To be passed in
      Normal  - 0         /  'fg%' only.
    And that's about it. Chop'n'change as you like!
    
  è Note:  (<- and -> are wraparounds)
    PROCcolour(34,0)
    PROCdoors_send("Created with !ReadTasks door (v2.00) by Richard Murray ->
   <-  - May 1994")
    REM ^^^ The line above *must* remain visible on-screen. You are not    ->
   <-  allowed to ^^^
    REM     colour it black or set it the same as the background. :-) By   ->
   <-  default it is
    REM     set to blue for ANSI, so it is a bit less intrusive.




COMING SOON:

  è System evaluator.

  è Module lister.

  è Anything else I think of...

  è A thing to show free space on sysop's disc drives. Will toggle a flag if
      to space left is LESS than that specified - useful to stop downloads to
      a full disc whilst you're away!
