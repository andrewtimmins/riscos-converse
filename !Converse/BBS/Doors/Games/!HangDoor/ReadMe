            How to set the door up
            ======================

Firstly you will need to edit the config file
Set the doornumber you wish hangman to repond to.
Set whether or not you want users to be able to gamble their ratios.
Set the UpdownConf, OnlineConf and Confdivide to your wishes
Set the Quit delay.

Some example words are already included with the door but so that
users don't know the answers you are advised to add your own.

In the words you can have hyphens, apostrophies and spaces but the maximum
length of the entry must be 14 characters.

Next you need to write the Menu data files for ARCbbs an example is
given below. This Shows the user the instruction screen, then enters
the door, and after the game it displays the high scores:

|hangman game
DOING"Hangman game"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.HangIns
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                                Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
OSCLI "WimpTask <ARCserver$Dir>.^.!HangDoor"
DOOR 9
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                                Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.HangScr
ECHO "{bfgbg bn}                                Press any key{std}"
ANYKEY
GOTO game

Below is also a little file to display the high scores:

| Hangman Scores
DOING "Hangman Scores"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.HangScr
ECHO "{bfgbg bn}                                Press any key{std}"
ANYKEY
GOTO game
|

An example Instruction page is also included within this application
called HangIns
