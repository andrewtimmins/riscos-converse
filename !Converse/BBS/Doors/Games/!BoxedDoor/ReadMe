          How to set the door up
          ======================

What you need to do:

Firstly you will need to edit the config file
Set the doornumber you wish boxed to repond to.
Set the Quit delay.

Next you need to write the Menu data files for ARCbbs an example is
given below. This Shows the user the instruction screen, then enters
the door, and after the game displays the high score:

|Boxed game
DOING"Boxed game"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.BoxedIns
ANYKEY
OSCLI "WimpTask <ARCserver$Dir>.^.!BoxedDoor"
DOOR 5
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.BoxScr
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                             Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
GOTO games

Note you should put the Instruction screen in the ARCbbs text directory

Below is also a little file to display the high scores:

| Boxed Scores
DOING "Boxed Scores"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.BoxScr
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                             Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
GOTO games
|


An example Instruction page is also included within this application
called BoxedIns
