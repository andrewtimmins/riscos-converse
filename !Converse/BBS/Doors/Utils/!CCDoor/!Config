; Below is a list of call rates. They must ALL be present. The cost shows
;  how much it would be for a one minute call using a certain setup. A one
;  minute call can only be imagined (!) for users of BT, as calls are `rounded`
;  up to the nearest 3 minutes. CCDoor does this automatically though.
; The cost is the amount of hundrenths of a penny, ie. If it was 4.2 pence per

; The third letter shows the time of day      D = Daytime, E = Evening
; The fourth letter shows the phone network   B = BT, M = Mercury
; First the local call rates...
