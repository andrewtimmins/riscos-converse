          How to set the door up
          ======================

What you need to do:

Firstly you will need to edit the config file
 Set the doornumber you wish Node Door to repond to.
 Alter BBSname to your system name
 Set the path of the Nodelist you want the prog to scan
 Set the Quit delay.

Next you need to write the Menu data files for ARCbbs an example is
given below.

|Node search
DOING"Nodelist search"
OSCLI "WimpTask <ARCserver$Dir>.^.Doors.!NodeDoor"
DOOR 8
GOTO public.main

The Door will search a copy of the nodelist specified in NodePath.
There are ~20,000 entries in the full nodelist which takes a few
minutes to search! Therefore, I would suggest you only have a
selection of the full node list so as to reduce scanning time.
Here at Rich in Paradise BBS I just have the entries for Zone 2.

I hope you find the door useful.

All the best,

Richard Paddle...
