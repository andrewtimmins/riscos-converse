Update history:

[ 1.00 ] - first release

[ 1.01 ] - added "-name" option, which should work with the forthcoming
           version 1.02.

           RiscBBS 1.01ß (March) is available in several places. As a last
           resort, request "RBFIX" from 2:292/500. However, Edward Hobson
           of the Power House (2:258/23, 2:258/24) has it on-line (somewhere)

[ 1.02 ] - Corrected some ANSI codes. Now works fine with TaskANSI+?

[ 1.03 ] - Added input queue. I was still using Carl's procs which are fine
           until you try to multitask but don't check for input... :-}

[ 2.00 ] - Re-written in C. I/O generalised for BBSs other than RiscBBS. Added
           setting of <NaixSChat$Return>, used by !WantedCht. F12-trap lost on
           the way :-%.
