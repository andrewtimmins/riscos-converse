# Messages

# The messages are not in alphabetical order! (You noticed?) They are in the
# order I implemented them. So there. I hope you can figure them out. If you
# translate them into a different language, please send the translated file
# to me; I will distribute it (adding country support on the way) and consult
# when I add new messages.
