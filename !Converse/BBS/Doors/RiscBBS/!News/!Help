!News version 1.00ß (2nd May 1992)
==================================

   This program is designed to display news bulletins either just after logon
or to handle the news section of a board. It will also only show news items
from a date specified in the 'Config' file.

Config file 
===========

   The program currently supports the following verbs in the config file, which
are pretty explanatory in themselves :-

   ";" - Signifies a comment line. Currently, any line is regarded as a comment
         if it doesn't contain one of the verbs listed here.

   "path " - Gives the path for the textfile to be displayed. Note that there
             must be a space after the verb, or it will not be recognised.

   "sysop " - Gives the sysop's (or the editor's name). Not currently used.

   "system " - Gives the system's name. Not currently used.

   "fcol " - Gives the default foreground colour for the text.

   "bcol " - Gives the default background colour for the text.

   "showall" - All the information in the newsfile will be shown, regardless of
               its date. This verb is optional if 'date ' is present.

   "date " - Gives a date for the program to start at. This is in the format
             'ddmmyy'. No separation can be used.

   Putting a date of "000000" has the same effect as the 'showall' verb.
   The only two optional verbs are 'showall ' and 'date '. However, if one is
missing, the other one must be present, or the program will not know where to
start in the news file.

News.NewsText File
==================

   The only command supported in this file is the '¤' one. This one signifies
that the text after it is a reference date.

e.g. 

¤020592

   Hi y'all. It's Brett here. This is just an example in the !Help file. Bye.

   The program will check that the date after the '¤' is the one it's looking
for. If it is, it will start there and display the rest of the text file. If it
isn't, it would carry on looking until it found a reference to the correct
date.

Coming Soon to a BBS near you...
================================

   The program will be almost unrecognisable in version 1.01, so beware!

PS - There's a demostration RunNews file for !RiscBBS in the !News directory.
     Just copy it into your BBS.ANSI dir and {show} it at the appropriate time!
     Hows that for simple installation!


Bug in 1.00 - If (S)top is used, the news file isn't closed and therefore the program
crashes nastily. Bug fix by Keith Hall (#298 on Cryton). (03/05/92)
