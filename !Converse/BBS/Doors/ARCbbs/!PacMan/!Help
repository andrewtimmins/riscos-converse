!PacMan 1.00 (04 Jan 97)

************************

 * What is it:

   This is just a silly game I wrote when I was bored. It is a BBS conversion
   of the classic game of the same name. (I don't really know why no-one else
   has written it!)


 * Instalation:

   Run the door in the usual way:
 
   ArmBBS: door `1 34 <ArmBBS$Dir>.Games.!PacMan`

   ArcBBS: OSCLI "WimpTask <ArcBBS$Dir>.Games.!PacMan"
           DOOR 34

   
   Inside the !PacMan directory there is a file called "Config", this file must contain
   the door number (i.e 34).
