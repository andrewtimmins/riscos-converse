                       This program is £5 SHAREWARE
     You may use it for a trial period of 2 weeks. When that time is up,
   you must either register it or destroy all copies of it which you own.
              To register, see the 'Registration' section.

What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~

    TronDoor is an addition to BBS Systems. It is a game, which is based
on the well known Tron. It will work with all BBS Systems which have the
capability to load ArcBBS doors, such as ArcBBS, ArmBBS and Newsflash (I'm
not sure about RiscBBS).

    Please note that, as yet, it DOES NOT WORK WITH ARCBBS AND NEWSFLASH. I
do not know why, and I am looking into this.

How it's distributed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    From now on, I'm distributing TronDoor (the unregistered version) as
compressed BASIC. This enables people to look at the code to check whether it
is 'suitable' for their BBS. If you register, I'm afraid that I can no longer
send registration keys anymore, and will send you an entirely new version,
which will be registered to you.

You are permitted to look at the code, but you must not change it in any way.
Although it may be easy to set it up so that it looks as if it is registered
to you, you do not have a unique code (KTxxxx), and therefore it is obvious
to whether it is legal or not.

How is it played?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    There are two players on either side of the screen (red and green), which
have to collect the dots (if applicable) and kill the opponent in one of
these methods:

    - Make it crash into itself
    - Make it crash into you
    - Make it crash into the wall

    You continue to play until either all the rounds is finished, or one
of the players presses CTRL-C.

Scores
~~~~~~

    Scores are as follows:

      25  for collecting a dot
      100 for killing the opponent

Two Players
~~~~~~~~~~~

    There are two ways in which two players can play against each other:

      1. Against someone at the same computer (remotely)
      2. Against the Sysop of the BBS (local and remotely)

    In order to play against someone on the same computer, you would choose
option [1] from the main menu. In order to play against the Sysop of the BBS,
you would choose option [2]. See 'Paging' for more information. Note that this
game would be hard to play over Telnet, due to the time it takes for information
to travel from computer to computer, defying the idea of 'quick reactions'.

Keys
~~~~

    The keys are very simple for TronDoor:

       Player 1:                 Player 2:

       Z - Turn Left             < - Turn Left
       X - Turn Right            > - Turn Right

    TronDoor will accept lower case letters as well.

Paging
~~~~~~

    Paging is the way in which you can play against the Sysop of the BBS. When
you select option [2] from the main menu, it will 'Page the Sysop'. If his/her
TronPager (see 'Configuration') is on, it will bring up a window on the Sysop's
screen with 4 options:

         - Accept: This starts the game with the remote computer.
         - Excuse: (not available in this version)
         - Ignore: This ignores the request, and stops the beeping. The person
                   on the remote computer does not know that you have clicked
                   on this.
         - Refuse: This refuses a request to play Tron with the remote computer.

    The only way to start the game is to therefore click on 'Accept'. In order
to play against the remote computer, you must open up a 'Snoop' window on
them (otherwise known as Snoop on them). Let them enter the necessary details,
and then start the game. Your name will automaticly be entered as player 2's.

    If you click on Accept, a small window will open up at the bottom-left of
the screen. This is how the Sysop plays. The Sysop's LightCycle can only be
controlled via this window, therefore not allowing the user to take over the
Sysop's controls. This only works if the window has an Input Focus (a beige
title bar). Once you click in another window, this will often take the input
focus away, and to get it back into the Local window, you must click on the
yellow 'TronDoor Local' icon.

Game Menus
~~~~~~~~~~

    When the game setup starts, there will be a requests to enter the names
for Players 1 and 2. You only need to enter the name for Player 2 if it is
not played against the Sysop.

    There will then be a request for:
                           _______________________
                          |                       |
                          | When would you like   |
                          | the game to end?      |
                          | [R]ounds  [C]TRL-C    |
                          |_______________________|

    This means that if you press 'R', the game will finish after a number of
rounds, but if you press 'C', the game will only finish when someone presses
CTRL-C. If you selected 'R', there will then be a window to enter how many
rounds until the game finishes.

    The next request is:
                           _______________________
                          |                       |
                          | How many bonus dots   |
                          | do you want the game? |
                          | Bonus dots: ___       |
                          |_______________________|

    You may now enter how many dots you wish to appear on the screen for you
to collect. Each dot you collect is worth 25 points. After you enter the amount,
a 3 second countdown will begin, and then you will be in the game.

The Arena
~~~~~~~~~

    At the bottom of the playing area is a statistics bar.
 ___________________________
|                           |
| ========Marc Warne======= | This is the name of the player
| Score: 00000000   001/050 | The score, followed by the round number, and no.
| 00 wins 00 losses 00 draws| Number of wins, losses and draws.        of rounds
|___________________________|

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    When TronDoor is loaded (either by a double click or by the BBS), the icon
appears on the icon bar. By clicking menu on it and then selecting Configure,
you will enter the configuration window.

    Options:

       - 'TronDoor Pager On' - Clicking on this will toggle the TronDoor pager
                               to be on or off
       - Door Number: 172    - The Door number (Default: 172)
       - Sysop's Name        - The name of the Sysop

       There will then be details of who this is registered to.

       - Save                - To save the configuration
       - Reload              - To reload the configuration

*** It is advisable to configure TronDoor ASAP, as (eg. if you are sleeping) ***
***  the TronDoor pager will automaticly 'beep' if the TronPager is left on  ***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    TronDoor is Shareware: You may use it for up to 2 weeks, after which you

                           You must tell me the Sysop's name and BBS name.
                           Do note that if you use it for over 2 weeks, without
                           it being registered, you are being against the law.
                           If ordered out of mainland UK, please include the
                           cost of postage.

(extreamly funny thingies) and Wow '96 (reviews)! Visit it!
