          How to set the door up
          ======================

What you need to do:

Firstly you will need to edit the config file
Set the doornumber you wish snake to repond to.
Set the Quit delay.

Next you need to write the Menu data files for ARCbbs an example is
given below. This Shows the user the instruction screen, then enters
the door, and after the game displays the high score:

|Snake game
DOING"Snake game"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.SnakeIns
ANYKEY
OSCLI "WimpTask <ARCserver$Dir>.^.!SnakeDoor"
DOOR 4
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.SnkScr
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                                Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
ECHO
GOTO games

Note you should put the Instruction screen in the ARCbbs text directory

Below is also a little file to display the high scores:

| Snake Scores
DOING "Snake Scores"
TYPE <ARCbbs$text>.SnkScr
ECHO "{bfgbg wb}                             Press any key{eol std}"
ANYKEY
ECHO
GOTO games
|
