!BoardList 1.02 (04 Jan 97)

===========================

 * What it does:

   Allows BBS users to access a database of BBS' online

   The menus are controlled by the cursor keys, but if any of your users have difficulties
   (i.e Hearsay II, doesn't send the correct codes), then they can use: 8=up, 2=down, 4=left, 6=right


 * Instalation:

   Run the door in the usual way:
 
   ArmBBS: door `1 75 <ArmBBS$Dir>.Doors.!BoardList`

   ArcBBS: OSCLI "WimpTask <ArcBBS$Dir>.Doors.!BoardList"
           DOOR 75

   
   Inside the !BoardList directory there is a file called "Config", this file must contain
   the door number (i.e 75), and if you are using ArmBBS or not.

 * Disclaimer:

   This door was originally written for RemoteAccess on the PC, and has been converted and IMPROVED
   for use on ARCbbs compatible systems by Matthew Page (using ANSI's similar to the orignals)
   Don't blame me if things go wrong! Not that they will ;)

 * History:

   1.00 - Programme written (and forgotten about)
          then released a while later ;)

   1.01 - Changed 'Software' field to 'Computer'
          Changed 'Nodes' field to 'Location'
          Added highlighted input fields when adding a BBS (so the user doesn't get confused)
          Changed the [DEL] to [ESC] for exiting screens
          Made screen redrawing much quicker for ArmBBS users ;) (sorry ARCbbs sysops!)
          * Thanks to John Stonier and Steve Smale for improvement suggestions *
          * Thanks must also go to Mike Mostowyj for the competition ;-D *

   1.02 - Re-wrote the ARCbbs ANSI display routines, should be alot quicker now (!)
          Added the new ArmBBS SWI so that screens should display better (thanks Keith)
          Now lets user #1 delete any BBS from the database (JS's request)
          Fixed the bug where you had to press escape a few times before it responded
