=========================================
V1.09 - Much better in all respects...

In the BBS script :
Run !Confusion
Then issue the door 199 command
eg: My script for ArmBBS,
-------------------------------------------------
  defitem *
  display `Multi user chat...`
  fail `You need a user level of at least 20! Enter the Questionnaire first!`
  access 20
  [
    doing `Virtual Confusion multi chat.`
    type <ArmBBS$Dir>.Menus.ANSIscrns.VConfusion
    pause 1
    oscli `Run <ArmBBS$Dir>.Doors.!Confusion`
    door `1 199`
    type <ArmBBS$Dir>.Menus.ANSIscrns.VConfQuit
    anykey
  ]
  enditem
----------------------------------------------
The type <blah blah>.Vconfusion and <xxxx>.Vconfquit
are only to display the title and quit screens...
Put these files where you want and change the type
lines accordingly, or don't use them atall if you
don't want to :-)

The door will only load up if there ISN'T a copy
already running *:-o
And also quits when the last user leaves the chat.

 THIS VERSION MAY BE DISTRIBUTED!
  *** UNALTERED AND COMPLETE ***

        BUT
 I take NO responsibility if it crashes
your BBS causing loss of 500Mb of files...
Anyway, that would be your fault for not
keeping backups wouldn't it!

I also take no responsibility for anything else!
eg.. People getting Virtually Confused while
using the chat  ;-) If anyone does use it that
is!

In other words :
 YOU USE THIS SOFTWARE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK


I would like someone to put my work to
good use so, feedback please!

reasonably small cost of £10 for all
my work. This will be introduced for the
later version's with pager systems
working and bugs fixed.

Previous versions :                         |
Records wern't kept of work before 0.07     |
So this is my first entry :                 |
                                            |
V0.07 - o Paging menu now works...          |
        o Slight alteration to highlighting |
          colours used by request of Cob.   |
                                            |
V0.08   o Everything seems to work great!   |
          BUT (sulk) it's far too slow when |
          you get a number of REAL users..  |
          It was tested on Digital Databank |
          and was worse than using a        |
          300baud modem ;-) So....          |
                                            |
V1.00   o Scrapped the old BASIC version..  |
          Went for a TOTAL rewrite in       |
          Arm Code Assembler (Oh no!)       |
          So absoutly nothing works again!  |
                                            |
      [time warp of about 2.5 weeks]        |
                                            |
V1.08   o Oops, I've not been filling       |
          this in have I                    |
                                            |
Forcast :                                   |
                                            |
V1.09 - o Thats wishful thinking the way I  |
          feel at the moment! (Knackered)   |

**************************************************
* Thanks to Ben Ingram for his handy information *
* about getting userdata from the module         *
* (for the online user bit in the pager system)  *
*    This big enough Ben?                        *
**************************************************

If the door for some reason dies, leaving a poor
BBS user stranded, running ReleaseAll will free him
(Also anyone else using any door so be aware of this!)

I will add a config file to set the doornum
or some way at least...
I can make a !RunImage with whatever doornum
you need, so there's no problem really.


 So, someone that actually reads to the end of
helpfiles! There's nothing interestiong down here
so go and set up the door or sit and stare at this
dot below if you really are that bored..
 It's my best effort at one of those stereograms...










 Dot->                         .
