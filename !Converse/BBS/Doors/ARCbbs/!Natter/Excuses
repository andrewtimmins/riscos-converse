I can't chat now, I'm using the phone
I'm out shopping, try later
I'm (still?) in bed
The cops are raiding my house
I'm dealing with a crisis
I'm eating; try me in 2 hours
I'm watching a film
I'm watching the telly
I'm installing the other 10 phone lines
I'm installing that 100Gb `jukebox` storage system!
But did you really want to chat to me?
I'm out; I'm _NOT_ sad!
I'm out modelling my Anorak
I'm out at the train station
I'm thinking about suicide; The BT bill came this morning
I'm doing something more productive; sleeping
I can't be bothered to chat; my fingers hurt!
I'm doing something much more important; Sleeping.
I'm relaxing, goooo away!
I'm building my nuclear shelter, so can't chat ;-)
I'm sat here really; but I don't want to chat to you ;-)
