=====================

 * What it does:
   
   !SysTasks is a door designed to give the user a detailed view of the loaded tasks
   and memory allocations on the BBS host computer.
   Basically and ANSI 'Programme Manager' (!) 

 * Instalation:

 This door will work on any ArcBBS compatible server, just set your desired
 door number in the `configure` file, within this directory, and call as you
 would any other door.

 eg.

 ArmBBS:

  defitem S
  display `Read System Tasks`
  [
    doing `Reading System Tasks`
    log `>SysTasks`
    door `1 63 <ArmBBS$Dir>.Doors.Utils.!SysTasks`
  ]
  enditem
 
 ArcBBS:
 
 OSCLI "WimpTask <ArcBBS$Dir>.Doors.!SysTasks"
 DOOR 63
 
 Any other server:
 
  erm...work it out yourself! ;-)
