                      Each row is separate from the rest.
 
 Each row uses a new pack of cards (in essence). The pack of cards only contain
 one of each, in the following order:
   
                      2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 J Q K A
                                      | | | ^ Ace
                                      | | ^ King
                                      | ^ Queek
                                      ^ Jack

[37;44m  How to Play  [33;40m
 
 From the card you are on, you have to determin whether the next card will be
 higher in value (as indiciated on the table above) or lower in value. Then you
 must press the key which correspondes to which value you want (H or L).
 
 Once you have made your choice, the next card will be revealed. If you are
 correct, then you will be credited apropraitly (unless you chose File Ratio;
 where you will only be credited at the end of the three rows). If you made an
 incorrect choice, then the game will be over, and you will be penilised as
 apropriate.

 You have the choice to change your card once per game. When you choose this,
 then the card you are on, will be changed to a card which hasn't been used
 in the row. Remember, you can only use this ONCE per game.
