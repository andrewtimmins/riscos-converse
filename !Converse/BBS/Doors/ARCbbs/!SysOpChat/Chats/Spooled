User :cooler. can u put like "adds" to the mainscreen ofc in ASCII? or "messages" 
User :if we have something nice here for people, like wolfenstein 3d shareware 
SysOp:You mean in the file base?

SysOp:Okay cool..
User :files we anyway can share. but im gonna check out everything exactly. 
User :dosrar, other utilities like some versions of symantec tools like norton 
User :commander are ok to share. that's good. so i make sure if people upload 
SysOp:If you can think of more fileareas that would be great.
User :stuff here, they use a wokring packager for it's time. let's keep it 
User :simple. i like what u did. because, what i noticed so far, people today 
User :have problems with navigate trough bbs's, but mostly because the "browsers" 
User :are complicated as fuck. that's why i prefer telix. and it works pretty 
User :well with ur bbs here. sometimes, on caveBBS as a example, there are 
User :commands u cant do, because they are configured on the browser for 
User :something already. bad, if u cant remap keys etc. but with telix u can do 
User :if necessary. but what i like here is the naviagtion. it's much better than 
SysOp:Yes, I wanted it to be easy to navigate from a users standpoint.
User :theCAVE. it is. alright, let me switch to the upload areas shortly, need to 
User :check out everything and spend some time here to check everything. im gonna 
SysOp:Just drop me a message withyou thoughts
