                    ONLINE, Real-Time ONLINE command door

About ONLINE:

     This door behaves in a similar way ArcBBS's ONLINE command (show list of 
     on-line users) right down to appearances. The only difference is it is 
     real-time, and will update once every 15 "Wimp_Poll"s. System loading is 
     approximately between 6% to 10%.


Installing ONLINE:

     Right. To install, load the <ONLINE$Dir>.Configure file. It's really
     simple, for a change... The number you see is the number that the door
     will be. Enter your chosen number and save.

     Then find your ONLINE menu script. Mine looks like:
       DOING "On-line users"
       ECHO "{std cls bfgbg wn}   ___  ___  ___    ___  ___{|}"
       ECHO "  /_   /  / /    / /  / /__/{|}"
       ECHO " /__  /  / /__  / /  / /  /          {fg g}USERS ON-LINE (real-
time){eol |}"
       ECHO "{eol std | |}"  
       ONLINE
       ECHO "{| | | _>0016}"
       ECHO "{bfgbg wb eol _>2223}Press any key{eol std}"
       ANYKEY
       GOTO sysutils.menu

     Remove or comment out the line that calls "ONLINE", and add in something 
     similar to:

       OSCLI "WimpTask <ArcBBS$Door>.!ONLINE"
       DOOR 29

     to call the ONLINE door.


A few points to note:

     1.   Is this door is 'real time', it requires the user to cancel the door
          by pressing a key (any key that returns a code > ASCII 2). Until the
          user does so, the door will not return.
     2.   The door will quit if the user drops carrier.
     3.   The user's port number is shown in white if contactable with 
          SubSpace/Parlez or similar - and red if not.
     4.   The display will get naffed if more than two people quit within the 
          same update. This seems unlikely though...
     5.   The program doesn't use much memory. My 'page size' is 32K, so the 
          WimpSlot is set to 32K. Users of computers with other page sizes 
          (1/2Mb or RiscPC) can play around and see what works best.
     6.   Each loop, the door backspaces and corrects itself, so it should 
          handle being placed in a scrolling position.

     You must know the blurb by now... :-)


History:

     This door contains a lot of stuff ripped from Parlez. The idea was to 
     have Parlez automatically update itself. However, due to certain 
     restrictions, this was not /easily/ possible. Then I thought about having
     the doing display 'real-time', as I'm forever bashing 'Who's on line?' 
     time after time to keep up with things. Hence this door.

     The latest update, version 1.10, alters the door so it will only update 
     the display if something changes. This won't make the door faster, but it
     will prevent the cursor from leaping all over the user's display.

     Please write and let me know if you use this door. It seems everybody is 
     using Ricky Sarge's SnooperPro. Did you know you can overlay this door on
     an ANSI graphic??? Simply load your graphic - move the cursor to the line
     before where you want ONLINE to output, then call output. :-)

     Like I said, most people use SnooperPro. Therefore I'll not mention 
     anything about this door and Andrew Lobel as it's largely academic now.
     <sigh> :-)
                                    Enjoy!
