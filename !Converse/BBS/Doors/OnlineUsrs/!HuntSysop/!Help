  1.02 User hangup while in door sorted out.
  1.03 Recognises pager status and says if you're in (use with CJ's !Pager)
       Slow modem detector. Any speed under 14k4 doesnt get the animation

  1.06 General code tidying. Frontend now runs in 48k, and the door in 32k
       Added "any key to abort animation" message to intro screen

       Note about any key to skip animations now flashes on intro screen

Hunt the sysop is a door to tell your BBS callers where you are when your
pager says you're "Unavailable".

It comes in two parts; an ArmBBS door for the BBS caller and a WIMP
frontend for you to set up / configure it how you want it.

Call the door with door `0 <Armbbs$dir>.doors.!huntSysop.!door -LINE¤line¤`
Load the WIMP frontend by double-clicking the !HuntSysop icon.

Setting up
----------

Once loaded, click the iconbar icon to open the control panel window.
From here, either select "Override timetable" and enter an excuse, or
select "Use timetable for excuses" in which case the timetable will be
used to automatically generate the excuse to be used.

You can predefine a list of excuses, available as a menu when you click the
icon to the right of the "Override" message. To access this list for editing
purposes, click the "Excuses list" icon. When you're done, resave the file.
The changes wont be available from the WIMP frontend until it is reloaded.

To setup/alter the automatic timetable, click the "Timetable" icon. Save
this when you've finished editing; no need to reload, although note that
the excuse shown in the window only updates when you reopen the window
or click on the "Use timetable" icon. The supplied example timetable file
has full instructions at the top describing its layout and conditions.

Future Improvements
-------------------

* Keep timetable excuse updated in the WIMP window

* Remove need to reload after editing of Excuses list file. Will monitor
  the file and re-load it when the datestamp changes (ie you resave it).

* Anything else anyone suggests! :-)

Legal Bits
----------

This is Freeware. Do what you want with it as long as a) I'm credited as
author, b) you dont make any money from it, c) You dont pass on altered
copies; if you make any alterations lemme have a look! :-)

I take no responsibility for this program. If it messes up on you, I will
not be held responsible for any damages or loss it may directly or indirectly
cause. Having said that, if you find any bugs lemme know and I'll see what I
can do! :-)
