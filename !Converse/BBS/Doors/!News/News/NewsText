   After a few hours hard slog, and some incredibly hard-to-find bugs, I've
finished !News v1.00ß! It now sings and dances quite happily with !RiscBBS
v1.01ß. All the user options are there in glorious technicolour (ok Red) and it
now waits for you to press a key!
   Read the !Help file if you are having any problems. Everything's pretty
straight forward, so there shouldn't be any unless they're bugs!
